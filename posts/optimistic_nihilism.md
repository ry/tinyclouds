This post is in response to the
[Optimistic Nihilism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14) video by
Kurzgesagt. Optimistic Nihilism perfectly describes my perspective on life and
the universe. I want to add my interpretation of the philosophy and spice it up
with some science fiction ideas.

## Nihilism

It's clear that in our modern era, with our extremely robust theories of
physics, backed by [extremely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO)
[precise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider)
[observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) of the
universe, that the religious explanations of existence are
[false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_Delusion). Our best understanding
is that we are matter, not unlike like the mountains and oceans and stars, that
over long periods of time, through intricate chemistry, became alive and then
conscious.

It is also clear that the universe does not care about us. I think it's
important to internalize how
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY59mR44TLs">quickly</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_zPvSLemdA">life</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B7-Zg7QmMA">can</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr7u345D3xc">end</a>. (Beware: the
links are videos of people dying.) You can simply be in the wrong place at the
wrong time, and nothing will save you from a rock slide, flash flood, or fire.
The tragedy will not be proceeded by dramatic music and it will not happen in
slow motion.

In the horrific nightclub fire video linked above, everything looks normal and
fun, and seconds later people are being burned alive. If pyrotechnics cause a
fire in a crowded room without sufficient exits, people will die. The universe
does not care.

In the past couple decades, we've come to understand how very isolated and rare
life is in the universe. Unfortunately, there are no green men on Mars. We
search and search for some evidence of any life anywhere&mdash;in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence">electromagnetic
magnetic radition</a>, in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)">Martian
soil</a>&mdash;the results are null. The universe is very large and it seems
likely that life must have developed elsewhere. But every passing year without
signal, clarifies how rare life must be. There is certainly no other
civilization in our solar system. And almost certainly none in our neighboring
stars. We are very alone.

Space exploration is a laudable endeavor that has increased our understanding of
the universe. But in all the talk of a manned mission to Mars, many people miss
an important truth: Mars is one of the last places we could ever go.

It's possible to send people to Mars; it might even happen in the next few
years. By stretching one's imagination generations into the future, it's
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Mars">maaaaybe</a>
possible we could have largish populations of humans on Mars... But the other
planets are utterly inhospitable. The surface of Venus is 400 degrees and the
atmosphere is so corrosive that it eats metal. The pressure on Jupiter would
crush spacecraft, and there's no way to escape once you go in. Its moons bask in
extreme radiation. Pluto is a pitch black icy rock in the middle of nowhere. I
suppose it's not physically impossible to land someone on Mercury or Ceres or
any other number of rocky bodies, but it's doubtful there's much to be gained
beyond flag planting.

The fastest speed ever achieved by a human made object was 25 miles per second
with the Juno spacecraft. If we somehow pack a ship with humans and supplies and
travel at that speed towards the nearest star, it would take
<a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=4.24+light+years+%2F+%2825+miles%2Fsec%29&oq=4.24+light+years+%2F+%2825+miles%2Fsec%29&gs_l=psy-ab.3...4834.6602.0.7435.6.6.0.0.0.0.159.645.3j3.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.3.348...33i22i29i30k1j33i160k1.KZ7oTn3-gOo">more
than 30,000 years</a>. 30k years might as well be a billion; when compared to
our 100 year lives, both are infinite. Star Trek-like warp drives are not
reality; there is no suggestion they ever could be.

Humans will never travel to the next star. It is completely infeasible.

All we have is this planet, and there are so many ways it can go wrong. It's
entirely conceivable that some chemical we're pouring into the environment
destroys some fragile balance, global temperatures rise and <b>we all die</b>.
It's entirely conceivable a human virus spreads through our dense global society
and <b>we all die</b>. It's entirely conceivable that a hunk of metal the size
of Manhattan falls from the sky and <b>we all die</b>.

The universe is unthinkably infinite, empty, and dead. There is nothing but
vacuum and rarely some rocks, forever, except here on this small globe. Life is
so utterly precious.

We are just beginning to understand the mechanisms of the brain. The emerging
understanding is that many <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron">small
cells</a> interact with electrical chemical pulses to process sensory
information and react with muscle movements. Although we don't understand the
mechanics of consciousness
(<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~graziano/Consciousness_Research.html">maybe</a>
it's some kind of control system for higher level
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6247">attention</a>), all evidence suggests
that it's an entirely physical process created by the interaction of neurons.

Thus when you die, and the cells in your head deteriorate, the animated flicker
of your being will cease to exist, forever. I echo Kurzgesagt and answer the
ancient question: <b>What happens when you die?</b> You simply cease to exist.

The consequence of this understanding? You are the rarest of rare matter in the
universe. You are much more precious than gold. You are the type of matter that
can walk and discuss and build.

You have a finite amount of time before the matter that is you ceases to be
animated.

## Optimism

"You only get one shot at life, which is scary. But it sets you free... If our
life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters... If
the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what that purpose is."

And don't spend your life doing something you don't want to be doing, if you can
help it.

There is technology that gives me hope.

The nascent field of Machine Learning has seen a remarkable simplification in
theory combined with practical progress in the past couple years. The best ML
algorithms are now, definitively, artificial neural networks; which were
designed with inspiration from brain biology. These neural networks are still
<a
href="http://tinyclouds.org/residency/">difficult to employ</a> and not well
understood, but it seems likely they will enable us to solve all sorts of
yet-unsolved problems.

Researchers in the discipline rightly are loath to make technological
predictions beyond tasks that are immediately achievable. But I think all are
quietly dreaming of true artificial consciousness. I'm more foolish than them,
so I will state my opinion publicly:

I see no reason why we would not be able to some day emulate brains and build a
machine that understands and thinks, like humans do. Artificial consciousness is
many years from reality, but it's more than conceivable. The foundational
components might already be emerging in
<a
href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/volta-gpu-architecture/">advanced
GPUs</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">back propagation frameworks</a>,
and
<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv">convolutional
architectures</a>.

Our bodies are fragile. They must stay within a small range of temperatures, we
must have certain chemicals to breath at a certain pressure, we must have food,
we must have sleep. We have many constraints on life. These constraints are not
circumventable.

However we can build things much stronger than our bodies.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXSi4GXUojo">Jet engines</a>, for
example, are complex machines that operate with remarkable reliability at high
temperatures. We have
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program">forging presses</a>
that can squeeze with enormous amounts of force. We have satellites that operate
for decades in hostile vacuum and radiation. We build very tall structures that
withstand the strongest winds without the slightest worry of collapse.

Unlike human bodies, an artificial consciousness on a microchip could live in
extreme conditions. Artificial consciousnesses could be suspended for hundreds
of thousands of years, in a spacecraft without life support. They could be sent
in many directions, with all of our knowledge, to wake in another age, orbiting
another star. Can we build electronics that can resume operation a million years
after being built? It's more likely than building a warp drive.

I hope artificial intelligence can be an avenue to securing our history and
keeping consciousness on Earth alive. Robust computers could be built that will
not die from viruses, that could survive a large meteor, that wouldn't die if
greenhouse conditions take hold and raise temperatures beyond that which natural
biology can endure.

worry that an artificial consciousnesses could turn against humans. I am not
concerned about this. First of all, we are many years away from such technology.
The "AI" that I deal with in my research is so laughably far from consciousness,
it's like worrying about lawnmowers turning against us. But this meme has gotten
enough attention that I want to address it: supposing that somehow we created an
artificial consciousness that was able to spontaneously improve itself and
escape from our control: are we doomed?

It seems that intelligence and abundance comes hand-in-hand with empathy.
Humans, more and more, are peaceful creatures. An increasing number are so
empathetic that they avoid eating animals entirely. If a super intelligence
could outsmart me, then it would also understand all that I've outlined above
about how fragile and rare life is. A super intelligence would, I think, be
super empathetic.
