[In 1995 Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to create interactive
websites](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/netscape-and-sun-unveil-javascript/).
Famously Brendan Eich spent only 10 days to create the first version of
JavaScript - a dynamic programming language with a roughly syntactic lineage
from Sun’s Java language. As a result of this partnership Sun held the trademark
“JavaScript”. In 2009 Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and
[the JavaScript trademark](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026640&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch)
as a result.

The trademark has no commercial value. Other than
[Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html),
Oracle does not have any products using the trademark and presumably no planned
usage. Oracle doesn’t even participate in the development of any of the
JavaScript engines like V8, JavaScriptCore, or Spidermonkey. It seems very
likely that JavaScript trademark infringement would be unenforceable in court
due to
[non-use](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/maintain/keeping-your-registration-alive).

Nevertheless the trademark is a dark cloud looming over the world’s most popular
programming language. Careful law abiding engineers bend over backwards to avoid
its use - leading to confusing terms like EcmaScript.

The best value Oracle could derive from the trademark would be from the goodwill
it receives by granting it into the public domain. It’s understandable why this
hasn’t yet happened - it would require a very forward thinking and high level
Oracle employee to propose something so intangible. Yet it is obviously the
right move.

Oracle, please release the JavaScript trademark.
