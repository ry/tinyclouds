title: We're Still Underestimating What AI Really Means

Most people are focused on short-term gains. Another tech wave, another startup
to spin up. It's easy to frame AI as the next platform shift like mobile or VR.
But that lens is much too narrow.

We're living through what may be one of the most significant moments in history:
the emergence of a new non-biological form of intelligent life.

And yet, it doesn't feel like it.

There's no cinematic score, no blinking AGI warning light. Just Slack threads,
blog posts, and conference panels. It reminds me of witnessing childbirth -
profoundly transformative, with some shocking moments, but also lots of mundane
time waiting around.

Meanwhile, the models keep improving. I've been following this since
[DeepDream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream) in 2015 where the
similarity to psychedelic experiences was eye-opening. Since then: ResNets,
GANs, AlphaGo, transformers, diffusion. Each expanded what machines can model
and reason about.

Many still treat today's models as narrow - powerful, but ultimately a tool like
any other. A better search engine. A neat hack for creating images. But that's a
misunderstanding of what AI has become.

Machine learning - now rightly called AI - is a deeply general-purpose field.
The same core techniques behind Midjourney and GPT share research lineage, and
often architecture. This isn't a stack of isolated tricks. It's one evolving
system architecture applied across language, vision, reasoning, robotics, and
more.

These systems are built on a mountain of science: decades of research, countless
failed experiments, and thousands of contributors.
([I've even contributed a few failures myself.](https://tinyclouds.org/residency))
And we haven't found the limits yet - these models can already translate
language, write poetry, generate high-definition video, and write deeply
technical software, and so much more.

Mobile technology was transformative. But general-purpose synthetic intelligence
is something else entirely.

And still, we treat it like a product cycle - the next wave of tools to write,
code, and build. That framing is tempting, but it assumes a clear boundary
between "tool" and... what? When a system can reason, create, and act through
agents, at what point does the distinction become semantic?

[The Turing test was passed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23674), and almost no
one remarked on it. For most of my life, that milestone felt impossibly far off
-- the thing that would prove AI had truly arrived. When we crossed it, there
was no headline. Just another Hacker News thread.

This is not just another technology. It's an inflection point in the story of
life on Earth.

There is turbulence ahead.
[Disasters are coming](https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-first-big-ai-disaster/).
Jobs will vanish. Industries will collapse. The arrival of AGI may trigger a
shockwave of scientific discovery -- breakthroughs cascading so quickly, human
ingenuity gets squeezed out. Beneficial on one hand, deeply troubling on the
other. Where that leaves us, I don't know. But it doesn't change the trajectory.

We are building the first intelligent entities that didn't evolve - we designed
them. Humanity may never leave this solar system due to our intrinsically
fragile biology. But our AI offspring might. It's very possible it will outlast
us.

Stop and take a moment. Look around. Recognize what's happening. This is what it
feels like to witness the birth of something beyond us. There's no background
music. But it's happening anyway.
